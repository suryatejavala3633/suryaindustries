# Firebase Deployment Guide for Surya Industries Dashboard

## Quick Start

### 1. Download Your Code
Since you can't directly export from this environment, you'll need to:

1. **Copy all files manually** from this project to your local machine
2. **Or use the export feature** if available in your development environment
3. **Or clone/download** if this is connected to a Git repository

### 2. Set Up Firebase

1. **Install Firebase CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Create a new Firebase project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Click "Add project"
   - Enter project name (e.g., "surya-industries-dashboard")
   - Follow the setup wizard

### 3. Initialize Firebase in Your Project

1. **Navigate to your project directory**
   ```bash
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Initialize Firebase**
   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```
   
   When prompted:
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Public directory: `dist`
   - Single-page app: `Yes`
   - Overwrite index.html: `No`

3. **Update .firebaserc**
   Edit the `.firebaserc` file and replace `"your-project-id"` with your actual Firebase project ID.

### 4. Deploy to Firebase

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to Firebase**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

### 5. Access Your Live Application

After deployment, Firebase will provide you with a URL like:
`https://your-project-id.web.app`

## Alternative: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up Firebase manually:

1. **Create firebase.json** (already included in the project)
2. **Create .firebaserc** (already included in the project)
3. **Update project ID** in `.firebaserc`
4. **Run deployment commands**

## Project Configuration

The project is already configured with:
- ✅ Firebase hosting configuration (`firebase.json`)
- ✅ Project configuration (`.firebaserc`)
- ✅ Build scripts in `package.json`
- ✅ Optimized Vite build settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Project not found"**
   - Make sure you've updated the project ID in `.firebaserc`
   - Verify you're logged into the correct Firebase account

2. **"Build failed"**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run lint`

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Make sure you have owner/editor permissions on the Firebase project
   - Try logging out and back in: `firebase logout && firebase login`

### Support Commands:

```bash
# Check Firebase CLI version
firebase --version

# List your Firebase projects
firebase projects:list

# Check current project
firebase use

# Switch to different project
firebase use your-project-id

# View hosting info
firebase hosting:sites:list
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Custom Domain** (Optional)
   - Go to Firebase Console > Hosting
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Follow the DNS configuration steps

2. **Analytics** (Optional)
   - Enable Google Analytics in Firebase Console
   - Add analytics tracking to your app

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Enable Performance Monitoring in Firebase Console
   - Monitor your app's performance metrics
